RQ:Is there a correlation between protein supply and fat supply across countries?”


Introduction
Problem statement and research motivation
Knowledge of world eating habit has gained more significance in assessment of human population health and nutritional sufficiency (Cobre et al., 2022). The food systems disruptions of COVID-19 influenced the availability and balance of the necessary nutrients, and it was pertinent to examine how nations differed in the consumption of protein and fat (Cobre et al., 2022). The current research problem is to examine the existence of a linear relationship between these two macronutrients over countries. The analysis of this association would allow determining whether an increased protein supply is always associated with an increased fat supply, which can be applied to food policy and nutrition planning. The results will be valuable to the global health organizations and researchers in the quest to enhance the world dietary standards (Shams et al., 2021).

Research question

RQ: “Is there a correlation between protein supply and fat supply across countries?”

This question aims at identifying the global intake of protein and fats whether the increase is together and using continuous data to investigate the strength and direction of linear association.

Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis (H0/H1) 

Null Hypothesis: Protein supply and fat supply have no correlation across the countries.

Alternative Hypothesis: Protein supply and the fat supply across countries show a statistically significant correlation.

Conclusions 

A significant positive correlation (r = 0.78) between the supply of protein from animal products and the supply of fat from animal fats across nations was found by the Pearson correlation analysis.  The correlation is statistically significant, as indicated by the p-value (<0.001).  Histograms supported the test's validity by confirming an approximate normal distribution (Dembinski et al., 2020).  This implies that nations with greater protein availability also typically have higher fat availability, which reflects global trends in the supply of macronutrients (Fereidouni et al., 2022).

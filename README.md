Introduction

Problem statement and research motivation

Knowledge of world eating habit has gained more significance in assessment of human population health and nutritional sufficiency. The food systems disruptions of COVID-19 influenced the availability and balance of the necessary nutrients, and it was pertinent to examine how nations differed in the consumption of protein and fat . The current research problem is to examine the existence of a linear relationship between these two macronutrients over countries. The analysis of this association would allow determining whether an increased protein supply is always associated with an increased fat supply, which can be applied to food policy and nutrition planning. The results will be valuable to the global health organizations and researchers in the quest to enhance the world dietary standards (Shams et al., 2021).

Research question



RQ: “Is there a correlation between protein supply and fat supply across countries?”



This question aims at identifying the global intake of protein and fats whether the increase is together and using continuous data to investigate the strength and direction of linear association.



Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis (H0/H1) 



Null Hypothesis: Protein supply and fat supply have no correlation across the countries.



Alternative Hypothesis: Protein supply and the fat supply across countries show a statistically significant correlation.


Evaluation 
What went well
The project was successful in converting raw data into insights to act upon. The group managed to employ statistical techniques and representations, which revealed the presence of major trends and patterns. The alignment of the members ensured that such tasks as the data cleaning, the coding, and the interpretation were accomplished effectively. RStudio made the process of work simpler and permitted reproducible and precise outputs that enhanced the trust in the findings.

Points for improvement
Even though improvements have been made, certain areas may be better. Data validation in the initial stages would have been more stringent to avoid minor inconsistencies. Furthermore, it would have been interesting to investigate more sophisticated tools of analysis, e.g. regression or clustering. Clarity would also be improved through greater documentation of coding decisions and challenges to be replicated later.

Group’s time management 
Time management was not problematic, and tasks were evenly spread and deadlines were met. Nonetheless, the last phases such as refinements in interpretation and visualization were much longer than expected. The efficiency of future projects would be better with the allocation of the additional buffer time on complex analyses.

Project’s overall judgement
The project met its goals and generated relevant findings through the use of strong statistical techniques. This team showed good skills in critical thinking and teamwork leading to the production of a succinct, credible, and informative report. The quality of future work might be enhanced through minor adjustments in data processing and exploration of the methods.

Conclusions 
A significant positive correlation (r = 0.78) between the supply of protein from animal products and the supply of fat from animal fats across nations was found by the Pearson correlation analysis.  The correlation is statistically significant, as indicated by the p-value (<0.001).  Histograms supported the test's validity by confirming an approximate normal distribution .  This implies that nations with greater protein availability also typically have higher fat availability, which reflects global trends in the supply of macronutrients

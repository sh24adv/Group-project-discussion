3.	Knowledge of world eating habit has gained more significance in assessment of human population health and nutritional sufficiency (Cobre et al., 2022). The food systems disruptions of COVID-19 influenced the availability and balance of the necessary nutrients, and it was pertinent to examine how nations differed in the consumption of protein and fat (Cobre et al., 2022). The current research problem is to examine the existence of a linear relationship between these two macronutrients over countries. The analysis of this association would allow determining whether an increased protein supply is always associated with an increased fat supply, which can be applied to food policy and nutrition planning. The results will be valuable to the global health organizations and researchers in the quest to enhance the world dietary standards (Shams et al., 2021).
